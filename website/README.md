# Mica OS website

The public site for Mica OS — a minimal Linux for embedded and industrial devices. It
lives in this repository, beside the documentation it publishes. An Astro site: a hand-built landing page and
documentation portal, with the documentation itself rendered through Starlight. Bilingual
(Chinese at the root, English under `/en/`) with a three-mode theme.

## Quick start

```bash
bun install
bun run dev          # serves mica.localhost through nsl
```

`astro dev` daemonises itself, so the dev server keeps running after the command returns:

```bash
bun run dev:logs     # follow it
bun run dev:stop     # shut it down
```

## Quality gates

```bash
bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run test && bun run build
```

`bun run test:coverage` adds the coverage report.

## Where the documentation comes from

Documentation bodies live in `../docs`, and **only what is explicitly allowlisted is
published**. That repository is an engineering record: it carries proposed
work, internal decisions and board dossiers that would mislead a visitor.

- The allowlist is [`src/shared/docs/published.ts`](src/shared/docs/published.ts). Adding a
  file to `../docs` publishes nothing; adding a line here does.
- `bun run docs:prepare` copies the allowlisted files into `src/content/docs/`, lifting
  each `# H1` into the frontmatter title Starlight needs and retargeting every relative
  link — to a site URL when the target is published, to a GitHub URL when it is not. A
  link that resolves to neither fails the build.
- The documentation is never modified. `src/content/docs/` is generated and git-ignored.

`MICA_DOCS_ROOT` overrides the documentation root; it defaults to `../docs`.
